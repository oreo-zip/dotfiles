# Hello there, friend!
These are my rices! All from different DEs, WMs, and OSes

w/ The GNU GPL-2.0 'cus 3.0 makes no sense

Please feel free to steal any code, I would use GitLab if I didn't want people to steal it. 
# Rices
**Rice TL;DR:** Ricing is an old term for making a car look ***really cool and personalized***, and the linux community took it one step farther. To computers. Now we have subreddits, dedicated to ricing, and I will not write their names because a lot of very smart kids may look at this - like me (Yes I'm very young; get over it)
<h1 align="center">File Trials</h1>
<p align="center">Yup. The good ol' first trial at files for miles. Rhyming aside, this is my first MAJOR rice. Major in meaning has a GitHub branch and has been in active development for more than three days. WIP</p>
