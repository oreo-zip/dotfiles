    Hello! I'm OREO ZIP! I'm really a <18yo kid that found his way into computers, named Gavin!
    <br>
    I love to make rices so here is my rice, made in openbox!
    <br>
    Yes its cool, No its not childish
    <br>
    Get Over It. <b><i>Like right now!</i></b>
    <br>
    Anyways, aside from the drama, this is an openbox rice. I don't think you needed me to say that for you to know that..... I won't sue you If you violate the GPL-2.0 license because this is literally a bunch of configs that were made entirely from me staring at reddit for 40+ hours. I really did read it! (<i>Get it?</i> No? Ok that's fair.) Like and subscribe for a cook-- wait no wrong one; Star and share this repo if you like it and the other rices, voilate the license if you so choose to, I honestly don't care. Aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnd PEACE. Wait no still gotta show you content WAIT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
